2017-11-05 MxMiner 0.2 (Windows)
========================
- Added full control over the AMD mining parameters. Use -ol to set the local worksize and -og to set the global worksize
Values must be increments of 32. Local worksize defaults to 128 while the global worksize defaults to 4096
Tweaking these settings can give a performance boost. For multiple cards use the same method as for -cd e.g -ol 128 128 128
- removed the ability to mine without supplying an address to prevent people unknowningly mining to the default example address
- Micro optimization in CPU miner.
- Donation fee is now optional and set to 1%. If you don't want to support my efforts for the minexcoin community it can be disabled
at any time by specifying the -nf parameter
- Measures to hopefully prevent miner from detected as an unwanted mining application by anti-virus software

GUI:
- 6th GPU device can now be selected in the GUI
- A maximum of 8 cards can now be selected from the GUI
- Added auto detection of platform ID for AMD devices. Assumed to be always 1 before, this is not the case
- Added option to the GUI to disable the 1% donation
- Fixed the calculation of expected profits
- Fix for fetching current wallet balance
